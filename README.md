### Features

Time block colors are updated based on the current hour. Past time blocks appear grey, the present time block appears red, and future time blocks appear green. Users can type directly in the time block and save their entry by clicking the blue save icon to the right of the text entry area. Entries are saved in local storage and will persist even after the page is closed.
